Hi there!

I've been working on a side project for while. ([Click here to see the project](https://github.com/rafitc/lamhat)) I had to explore go lang for the project.

In my use case, i want a object storage feature like s3 bucket or google file storage. I found opensource solution [minio](https://min.io) is the right tool for me.
I've self hosted the tool in my server with very minimum spec, it is working very well.
Then i wanted to integrate it with my go application. I used minio's [go sdk](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/minio/minio-go) for this.

I wanted to do multiple file uploads at same time quickly. So, i used go routines and channel to upload all files parallely.

### Go initial setup

Create a simple go project. (hope you have go installed. if not [refer here](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started))

```jsx
console.log("Hello World");
```
